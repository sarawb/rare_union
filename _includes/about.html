          Rare Union is led by Sara Wachter-Boettcher, a content strategy expert, author, and speaker who has worked on the web since 2005. Since launching her consultancy in 2011, she’s led projects and facilitated workshops for Fortune 100 corporations, education and research institutions, and both B2B and consumer startups. She lives in Philadelphia, but she’s still not quite sure she’s saying jawn correctly.
